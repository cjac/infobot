# If a unit is defined as `***', that means
# it has no definition because it is a fundamental unit.

# Fundamental units:
# Seven instrinsic SI units:
gram       ***
meter	   ***
second     ***
ampere     ***
candela    ***
Kelvin     ***
mole       ***
# Two supplementary units

# Some miscellany
